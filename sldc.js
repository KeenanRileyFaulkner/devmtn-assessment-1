// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing & Integration
// 6. Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";
const analysisOfRequirements = "The second step in software development, analysis of requirements involves business modeling and delineating exactly what the software must be able to accomplish in order to achieve the end goal";
const design = "Software is designed before it is coded. Project managers meet and determine how the project is to be built, which involves everything from what specific pages or backend features will be necessary to achieve front end functionality, to who will be involved in each component";
const implementation = "This is the actual coding phase of the project, when features are first psuedo-coded, then implemented. Often, this work happens in pairs, although it may not depending on company practices.";
const testingAndIntegration = "Quality assurance must be performed on software before it is pushed out to the public. The software must be tested for critical bugs and the production team must ensure that it meets the minimum requirements of the client.";
const maintain = "Software typically doesn't stay stagnant. It changes over time. Maintainance is the process of making that happen. This involves everything from periodic updates, to transitioning to more modern practices and technologies that ensure greater security.";
